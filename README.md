# SpotifyArtistTrackRanks
Uses the spotipy library to interact with the Spotify API, retrieving information on every track listed on spotify for a certain artist via their spotify URL.

Was created to track the popularity of artist's tracks in an attempt to rank them by importance through both time and across various countries. Was made for a presentation on Weezer particularly, hence the text file.
Also used the billboard API to see where the track's peak position on the hot-100 chart is and how long it was on the chart for to use as another measurement of popularity.
